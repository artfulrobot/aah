/**
 * This is a placeholder for civicrm.css in the 'aah' theme.
 * Here are a few ideas on what to do about it:
 *   - Make a real CSS file (e.g. by hand-coding or setting up a SASS/SCSS build process).
 *   - Inherit the stock Greenwich file:
 *       - Edit the file 'aah.theme.php'
 *         and add 'greenwich' to the 'search_order'
 *       - Delete this copy of 'civicrm.css'
 *   - Disable this file completely:
 *       - Edit the file 'aah.theme.php'
 *         and add 'css/civicrm.css' to the 'excludes' list
 *       - Delete this copy of 'civicrm.css'
